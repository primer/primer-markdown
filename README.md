# :warning: This repo is deprecated!
We've moved all of the Primer CSS modules to a [single repository][repo]. You can still install and update `primer-markdown` with npm or Yarn, but its [code] and [issues] now live elsewhere.

[repo]: https://github.com/primer/primer-css
[issues]: https://github.com/primer/primer-css/issues
[code]: https://github.com/primer/primer-css/tree/master/packages/primer-markdown
